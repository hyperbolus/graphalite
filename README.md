When you find out, let me know too

# Credits
- Absolute for the blocks.h file I turned into JSON
- IliasHDZ I was originally gonna credit for GDViewer/GDRenderW but their code ended up actually teaching my nothing about using WebGL and I used nothing from it so I guess credit for inspiring and doing it first probably
